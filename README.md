# Santa Cruz County Gonorrhea Survey 
[Back to the portfolio page...](https://marialma.github.io/)

Data is not for distribution.

I am generating descriptive graphs for gonorrhea diagnoses in Santa Cruz County, looking at 2015-2017. However, because at the time of writing, 2017 is not yet over, the 2017 data is only current through to mid-November. 

The stats here are purely descriptive, as gonorrhea is my outcome variable and I don't have very much data for the rest of the county.

The groupings that I hope to look at are: 
* Age group, gender, sexual orientation trends over time
* How people are getting diagnosed
* Gonorrhea and incarceration
* Gonorrhea and drug use
* Trends in partner notification
* Trends in where people are meeting partners
  * Websites/app trends?

I will share the results after getting approval to do so.
